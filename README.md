# React-Native-Tutorial

I'm submitting this about an hour in to the tutorial.  The code for the most part has no issues.  The only quirk is that I did not put my code into a seperate 'src' file like as requested by the tutorial as it seemed to many errors.  I of course also had issues with Expo, but those issues have largely been solved.
